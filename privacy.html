    <h2>Welcome to VetConnect's Privacy Policy</h2>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Hi there, we're <strong>VetConnect</strong> and welcome to our privacy policy. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re a VetConnect user or visitor to our Sites.</li>
        <li>When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘VetConnect’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.</li>
        <li>If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The type of personal information we collect</h2>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites.</li>
        <li>The most common types of information we collect include things like: user-names, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact details, survey responses, blogs, photos, payment information such as payment agent details, transactional details, tax information, support queries, forum comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our Sites (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data. We will also collect personal information from job applications (such as, your CV, the application form itself, cover letter and interview notes).</li>

        <li>As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a legitimate interest in verifying the identity of our authors. We believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces by reducing fraud, making authors more accountable for their content and giving VetConnect and customers the ability to enforce contracts for authors who break the rules. VetConnect also has certain legal obligations that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances.</li>
